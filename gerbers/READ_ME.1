FLASH PAD GEOMETRY:

     NEGATIVE LAYER FLASH PADS;

        1, Thermal Relief flash Pads. Are dimensioned in mils,
           without leading zeros. They are encoded as follows:

           t 90 70 15x45 sp4
           | |  |    |    |_ number of spokes
           | |  |    |
           | |  |    |_spoke width and angle
           | |  |
           | |  |_inside diameter
           | |
           | |_outside diameter
           |
           |_thermal relief

        2, tdirect  Is used to make full contact with the plane.
                    A 5 mil circle or blank flash may be substituted.

        3, Anti-pad with copper pad retained. Used on negative layers
           where pad must be used as land contact for blind or buried
           vias.

           | |  | 
           | |  |_ outside anti-pad dimention
           | |

              c = circular i.d. o.d. dimentions

     POSITIVE LAYER FLASH PADS;

        1, cir40 (cir#) Is used to indicate a spotting pad for non-
                        plated holes. A 40 (or #) mil circle or blank
                        flash may be substituted.

        2, Doughnut pads are used where land is required around non-
           plated holes, with relief of the land for the non-plated 
           drill. They are encoded as follows:

           dp 250 x 190
            |  |     |_ inside diameter
            |  |
            |  |_ outside diameter  
            |
            |_ doughnut pad
